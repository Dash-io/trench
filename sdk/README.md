## Test device data collection

Follow the steps to set up a simple app for testing device data collection.

1. Install dependencies: `yarn ` or `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`

When you click "Initialize Session" while the dashboard is running, you should see a row inserted into the Session and DeviceSnapshot tables containing information about your device.

See `example/App.tsx` for the code.
