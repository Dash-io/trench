## Overview

Trench is an open-source payment fraud prevention platform, built for engineers.

## Features

- SDK to collect device signals
- Dashboard for fraud workflows
    - Identify and label fraud
    - Export raw data for analysis
- Custom rule engine
    - Integrate complex custom data using [Flow](https://github.com/trytrench/flow)

## Design Philosophy

- **Full customization.** You know your product and user interactions better than anyone else. To be effective, you should have full control over the data you collect and integrate.
- **Full access to your data.** You shouldnâ€™t be limited to dashboards and reports. Full access to your data is needed to properly understand your fraud.
