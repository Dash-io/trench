## Overview

Trench is an open-source fraud prevention platform for marketplaces.

## Features

Trench lets marketplaces prevent buyer and seller fraud in one platform. With Trench, you can:
- Review sellers by KYC/KYB and by buyer history
- Set transaction limits for buyers and sellers
- Automatically assess payments based on buyer and seller data
- Integrate directly with Stripe Payments, Identity, and Connect
 
## Design Philosophy

- **Full customization.** You know your product and user interactions better than anyone else. To be effective, you should have full control over the data you collect and integrate.
- **Full access to your data.** You shouldnâ€™t be limited to dashboards and reports. Full access to your data is needed to properly understand your fraud.
